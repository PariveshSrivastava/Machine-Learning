# Machine-Learning

This repo contains Basic implementations of ML model and theory relating to the model

It also contains some data sets that the model was practiced on

The steps followed for every model were:
- import required libraries 
- get the data
- splitting the data into test,train
- Creating the model either from scratch or from library
- Traning the model on training data
- Checking the accuracy of model with different methods
